Bellow you can find the list of documents to set up a company by non-resident. Please, note that points 1-3 referrer to 
foreign legal entities founding the company in Ukraine. If the founder is a foreigner individual, instead of that documents
he/she would need to provide duly legalized (or appostilled or just notarized, depending of the origin country) Power or 
Attorney or to be presented personally in Ukraine to sign statutory and other documents of the company at notary.

**1. A decision of company-founder to establish a limited liability company (LLC) in Ukraine**

This document may be in the form of the Minutes of Shareholders/Participants/ of the company or other authorized body of the
company. In this document the company-founder shall define the type (LLC) and the name of the company to be established in 
Ukraine, to appoint representative to be presented on General Meeting of Participants of the Ukrainian LLC and sign the 
statutory documents and Minutes of the Ukrainian LLC from behalf of the company.

**2. An extract from commercial/court/banking registry issued in the country of the founder confirming the state registration 
of the company-founder**

Please, be informed that starting from 2010 the extract shall contain the beneficial owners - individuals. It means that in 
case the obtained extract contains information of the founders which are legal entities, we would need the extracts of these
entities and so on till the individuals will be shown.

Apart from the above, for the purpose of the company registration, we might need the copies of founding documents 
(Charter, Articles of incorporation etc) of the companies-founders. Though it is not requirement of the law, but some of the
authorities might require it).

It should be mentioned though that there is a legal way to avoid this requirement, which would make the process of 
registration of company a bit longer.

**3. Power of attorney authorizing persons who sign the foundation documents (e.g. Charter) and the Minutes of the General 
Meeting of Participants/Founders on behalf of the companies-founders and individuals who will take all actions required for
the registration of LLC in Ukraine**

The power of attorney is required if none of the individuals indicated in the extract (see item 2 above) as those who has 
authority to represent the founder is going to be physically present in Ukraine to sign the Articles, minutes and other 
documents (e.g. a lease agreement) of Ukrainian LLC in front of the notary public.

**4. Lease agreement**

The company shall have a legal address before registration process started. The location of leased premises will determine 
the local authorities where LLC will shall be registered, including tax inspection. The legal address should be proven by
signed lease agreement. Before establishment of the company, this agreement can be signed by the authorized representative 
of any company-founder or at least the address should be known to start registration process.

**The above documents (clauses 1-3) should be legalized or apostilled (if the country is a party to a convention Hague 
Convention Abolishing the Requirement for Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, October 5, 1965). If the company-founder
is CIS-based legal entity the documents should be only notarized.**

If any of the documents referenced above consists of more than one page, then all pages of such document should be stitched
together to ensure that no page can be removed and that not only the last page but the whole document is notarized and
apostilled (or legalized). Here in Ukraine these documents will be translated into Ukraine with notarization of the 
translation before starting of registration process.

The templates of the above documents along with English version of charter of LLC will be provided by the request.
